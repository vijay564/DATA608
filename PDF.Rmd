**Principles of Data Visualization and Introduction to ggplot2**

I have provided you with data about the 5,000 fastest growing companies in the US, as compiled by Inc. magazine. lets read this in:

```{r}
inc <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charleyferrari/CUNY_DATA_608/master/module1/Data/inc5000_data.csv", header= TRUE)
```

And lets preview this data:

```{r}
head(inc)
```
```{r}
summary(inc)
```

Think a bit on what these summaries mean. Use the space below to add some more relevant non-visual exploratory information you think helps you understand this data:

```{r}
# Insert your code here, create more chunks as necessary

# Maximum Growth Rate
(Growth <- inc[which.max(inc$Growth_Rate),])

# Maximum Revenue
(Revenue <- inc[which.max(inc$Revenue),])

# Maximum Employees
(Employees <- inc[which.max(inc$Employees),])
```
